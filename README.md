Return the output in HTML format optimized for embedding in a Streamlit app. Use inline CSS styling to make the content visually appealing and mobile-responsive. Include modern fonts, padding, spacing, colors, and clean layout. Structure the response using sections, headings, and use tables or cards where needed. Avoid external CSS or JavaScript. Do not include <html>, <head>, or <body> tags â€” only the inner content. Make sure it's suitable for rendering with st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True).
