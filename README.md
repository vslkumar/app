Return the output in HTML format optimized for embedding in a Streamlit app. Use inline CSS styling to make the content visually appealing and mobile-responsive. Include modern fonts, padding, spacing, colors, and clean layout. Structure the response using sections, headings, and use tables or cards where needed. Avoid external CSS or JavaScript. Do not include <html>, <head>, or <body> tags — only the inner content. Make sure it's suitable for rendering with st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True).


generate the output in fully styled HTML format. The HTML should be visually appealing, with modern UI/UX best practices applied — including good use of colors, spacing, fonts, and layout. All styles should be included inline or within a <style> tag so that the HTML is self-contained. The output should look professional and engaging when displayed in a web browser or in a Streamlit UI using st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True). Please ensure the output is easy to read, aesthetically pleasing, and not just raw JSON or plain text — use headings, paragraphs, tables, badges, icons, borders, shadows, or other UI elements where suitable to enhance clarity and visual impact.
